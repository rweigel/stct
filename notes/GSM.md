The following are notes on the Geocentric Solar Magnetospheric coordinate frame.

This coordinate frame has been referred to as Geocentric Solar Magnetic (GSM) (Laundal and Richmond, 2017), Solar Magnetospheric (SM).

GSM: Geocentric Solar Magnetospheric system. This has its X-axis from the Earth to the Sun. The Y-axis is defined to be perpendicular to the Earth's magnetic dipole so that the X-Z plane contains the dipole axis. The positive Z-axis is chosen to be in the same sense as the northern magnetic pole. The difference between the GSM and GSE systems is simply a rotation about the X-axis.

* $+Z$-axis: projection of northern dipole axis on $\text{GSE}\_D$ $YZ$ plane
* $+X$-axis: vector Earth-Sun of date

* $X$= Earth-Sun line
* $Z$= Projection of dipole axis on $\text{GSE}$ $YZ$ plane

The geocentric solar magnetospheric system (GSM), ... has its $X$-axis from the Earth to the Sun. The $Y$-axis is defined to be perpendicular to the Earth's magnetic dipole so that the $X-Z$ plane contains the dipole axis. The positive $Z$-axis is chosen to be in the same sense as the northern magnetic pole.

# [SPASE](https://spase-group.org/data/model/spase-2.4.0/spase-2_4_0_xsd.html#CoordinateSystemName)

Geocentric Solar Magnetospheric - A coordinate system where the X axis is from Earth to Sun, Z axis is northward in a plane containing the X axis and the geomagnetic dipole axis. See Russell, 1971.

The Geocentric Solar _Magnetic_ (GSM) base vectors are:

$\hat{\mathbf{x}}\_\text{GSM} = \hat{\mathbf{s}}$

$\hat{\mathbf{z}}\_\text{GSM} = \hat{\mathbf{m}}\_{GEO} \times \hat{\mathbf{x}}\_\text{GSM}/|\hat{\mathbf{m}}\_{GEO} \times \hat{\mathbf{x}}\_\text{GSM}|$

$\hat{\mathbf{z}}\_\text{GSM} = \hat{\mathbf{x}}\_\text{GSM} \times \hat{\mathbf{y}}\_\text{GSM}$

where $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$ is a unit vector in the geocentric coordinate system that points from the Earth to the Sun.
