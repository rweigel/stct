GSW," Geocentric Solar Wind","The Geocentric Solar Wind (GSW) coordinate system takes into account the actual direction of the solar wind at the Earth's location. The GSW system differs from the standard GSM only in that its $X$-axis is directed anti-parallel to the observed solar wind flow, rather than to Sun's center, which more accurately takes into account the aberration effect.\n\n## Difference between the GSM and GSW coordinate systems\n\nThe most frequently used coordinate system in solar-terrestrial physics is the Geocentric Solar  Magnetospheric (GSM) system. The standard GSM has its $X$-axis pointing toward the Sun, the $Z$-axis is perpendicular to $X$ and belongs a plane formed by the $X$-axis and the Earth's dipole axis, and the $Y$  completes a right-handed orthogonal set. \n\nTo be more precise, one should also take into account that the solar wind does not arrive radially but approaches  from $\alpha^{\circ}$ west of the Sun due to the Earth's orbital motion, where $\alpha=\arctan(V_E/V_{SW})$ and  $V_E=29.77$ km/s. On average, $\alpha$ is equal to $\sim 4^{\circ}$ assuming the solar wind speed $V_{SW}\sim 425$ km/s.  Here we should note that [the OMNI data](https://omniweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/form/omni_min.html) are provided with the  already removed aberration from the solar wind velocity component (the correction $V_Y=-29.77$ km/s introduced). \n\nIf the actual direction of the solar wind is known, then even more precise Geocentric Solar Wind (GSW) coordinate system  may be used. It differs from the GSM system only in that $X_{GSW}$ axis is directed anti-parallel to the observed solar  wind flow, which more accurately takes into account the variable aberration effect.

      Geomagnetic - geocentric. Z axis is parallel to the geomagnetic
      dipole axis, positive north. X is in the plane defined by the Z axis
      and the Earth's rotation axis. If N is a unit vector from the Earth's
      center to the north geographic pole, the signs of the X and Y axes are
      given by Y = N x Z, X = Y x Z.. See Russell, 1971
      

      The implementation of this frame is complicated in that the definition
      of the IGRF dipole is a function of time and the IGRF model cannot be
      directly incorporated into Spice. However, Spice does allow one to define
      time dependent Euler angles. Meaning, you can define an Euler angle
      that rotates GEO to MAG for a given ephemeris time t:

         V           = r(t) * V
          GEI                  MAG
      
      where r(t) is a time dependent Euler angle representation of a
      rotation. Spice allows for the time dependence to be represented by a
      polynomial expansion. This expansion can be fit using the IGRF model,
      thus representing the IGRF dipole axis.

      IGRF-11 (the 11th version) was fit for the period of 1990-2020, which
      should encompass the mission and will also make this kernel useful for
      performing Magnetic dipole frame transformations for the 1990's and
      the 2000's. However, IGRF-11 is not as accurate for this entire time
      interval. The years between 1945-2005 are labeled definitive, although
      only back to 1990 was used in the polynomial fit. 2005-2010 is
      provisional, and may change with IGRF-12. 2010-2015 was only a
      prediction. Beyond 2015, the predict is so far in the future as to not
      be valid. So to make the polynomials behave nicely in this region (in
      case someone does try to use this frame during that time), the
      2015 prediction was extended until 2020. So for low precision, this
      kernel can be used for the years 2015-2020. Any times less than 1990
      and greater than 2020 were not used in the fit, and therefore may be
      vastly incorrect as the polynomials may diverge outside of this region.
      These coefficients will be refit when IGRF-12 is released.
      
      Also, since the rest of the magnetic dipole frames are defined from
      this one, similar time ranges should be used for those frames.

      In addition to the error inherit in the model itself, the polynomial
      expansion cannot perfectly be fit the IGRF dipole. The maximum error
      on the fit is .2 milliradians, or .01 degrees. 

      The MAG frame is achieved by first rotating the GEO frame about Z by
      the longitude degrees, and then rotating about the Y axis by the
      amount of latitude. This matches the new frame to Russell's definition.",TREPS_frames,"https://gitlab.irap.omp.eu/CDPP/TREPS/blob/master/server/kernel/data/frames.xml","software/TREPS_frames-2023.xml"
