GSW, Geocentric Solar Wind,"The Geocentric Solar Wind (GSW) coordinate system takes into account the actual direction of the solar wind at the Earth's location. The GSW system differs from the standard GSM only in that its $X$-axis is directed anti-parallel to the observed solar wind flow, rather than to Sun's center, which more accurately takes into account the aberration effect.\n\n## Difference between the GSM and GSW coordinate systems\n\nThe most frequently used coordinate system in solar-terrestrial physics is the Geocentric Solar  Magnetospheric (GSM) system. The standard GSM has its $X$-axis pointing toward the Sun, the $Z$-axis is perpendicular to $X$ and belongs a plane formed by the $X$-axis and the Earth's dipole axis, and the $Y$  completes a right-handed orthogonal set. \n\nTo be more precise, one should also take into account that the solar wind does not arrive radially but approaches  from $\alpha^{\circ}$ west of the Sun due to the Earth's orbital motion, where $\alpha=\arctan(V_E/V_{SW})$ and  $V_E=29.77$ km/s. On average, $\alpha$ is equal to $\sim 4^{\circ}$ assuming the solar wind speed $V_{SW}\sim 425$ km/s.  Here we should note that [the OMNI data](https://omniweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/form/omni_min.html) are provided with the  already removed aberration from the solar wind velocity component (the correction $V_Y=-29.77$ km/s introduced). \n\nIf the actual direction of the solar wind is known, then even more precise Geocentric Solar Wind (GSW) coordinate system  may be used. It differs from the GSM system only in that $X_{GSW}$ axis is directed anti-parallel to the observed solar  wind flow, which more accurately takes into account the variable aberration effect. The GSW system was first introduced  and described by [Hones et al. (1986)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0032063386900012)."
