HeliocentricMeanEcliptic,Heliocentric Aries Ecliptic (Mean) AKA: HAE; HEC; Astropy’s HeliocentricMeanEcliptic,"Heliocentric mean ecliptic coordinates. These origin of the coordinates are the center of the sun, with the x axis pointing in the direction of the mean (not true) equinox as at the time specified by the equinox attribute (as seen from Earth), and the xy-plane in the plane of the ecliptic for that date."
Heliocentric,"HCC","A coordinate or frame in the Heliocentric system, which is observer-based.\n\nThe origin is the center of the Sun.\n\nThe Z-axis is aligned with the Sun-observer line.\n\nThe Y-axis is aligned with the component of the vector to the Sun’s north pole that is perpendicular to the Z-axis.\n\nThis frame defaults to a Cartesian component representation, which is known as Heliocentric Cartesian (HCC). This frame can also be represented using cylindrical components, where where rho is the impact parameter and psi is the position angle. psi is measured relative to the west limb, rather than solar north, so is shifted by 90 degrees compared to the convention of the Heliocentric Radial (HCR) system."
HeliocentricEarthEcliptic,"HEE","A coordinate or frame in the Heliocentric Earth Ecliptic (HEE) system.\n\nThe origin is the center of the Sun.\n\nThe X-axis (0 degrees longitude and 0 degrees latitude) is aligned with the Sun-Earth line.\n\nThe Z-axis (+90 degrees latitude) is aligned with the component perpendicular to the X-axis of the mean ecliptic pole at the observation time."
HeliocentricEarthEquatorial,HEEQ; HEQ,"A coordinate or frame in the Heliocentric Earth Ecliptic (HEE) system.\n\nThe origin is the center of the Sun.\n\nThe X-axis (0 degrees longitude and 0 degrees latitude) is aligned with the Sun-Earth line.\n\nThe Z-axis (+90 degrees latitude) is aligned with the component perpendicular to the X-axis of the mean ecliptic pole at the observation time."
HeliocentricInertial,HCI,"The origin is the center of the Sun.\n\nThe Z-axis (+90 degrees latitude) is aligned with the Sun’s north pole.\n\nThe X-axis (0 degrees longitude and 0 degrees latitude) is aligned with the solar ascending node on the ecliptic (mean J2000.0)."
Heliocentric Radial,HCR; similar to Heliocentric,"Use a cylindrical representation, but with a 90-degree offset in psi because Heliocentric in cylindrical measures counter-clockwise from the west limb rather than solar north"
Heliocentric/Heliographic Radial-Tangential-Normal,HGRTN; similar to Heliocentric,"The axes are permuted, with HCC X, Y, Z equivalent respectively to HGRTN Y, Z, X"
HeliographicCarrington,Heliographic Carrington; HGC,"A coordinate or frame in the Carrington Heliographic (HGC) system.\n\nThe origin is the center of the Sun.\n\nThe Z-axis (+90 degrees latitude) is aligned with the Sun’s north pole.\n\nThe X-axis and Y-axis rotate with a period of 25.38 days.\n\nThis system differs from Stonyhurst Heliographic (HGS) in its definition of longitude. This longitude is an “apparent” longitude because it takes into account the time it takes for light to travel from the Sun’s surface to the observer (see Calculating Carrington longitude). Thus, the observer needs to be specified to be able to transform to any other coordinate frame."
HeliographicStonyhurst,Heliographic Stonyhurst; HGS,"A coordinate or frame in the Stonyhurst Heliographic (HGS) system.\n\nThe origin is the center of the Sun.\n\nThe Z-axis (+90 degrees latitude) is aligned with the Sun’s north pole.\n\nThe X-axis (0 degrees longitude and 0 degrees latitude) is aligned with the projection of the Sun-Earth line onto the Sun’s equatorial plane.\n\nThis system is also know as the Heliocentric Earth Equatorial (HEEQ) system when represented using Cartesian components."
Helioprojective,Helioprojectic Cartesian; HPC,"A coordinate or frame in the Helioprojective Cartesian (HPC) system, which is observer-based.\n\nThe origin is the location of the observer.\n\nTx (aka “theta_x”) is the angle relative to the plane containing the Sun-observer line and the Sun’s rotation axis, with positive values in the direction of the Sun’s west limb.\n\nTy (aka “theta_y”) is the angle relative to the Sun’s equatorial plane, with positive values in the direction of the Sun’s north pole.\n\ndistance is the Sun-observer distance.\n\nThis system is frequently used in a projective form without distance specified. For observations looking very close to the center of the Sun, where the small-angle approximation is appropriate, Tx and Ty can be approximated as Cartesian components."
GeocentricEarthEquatorial,Geocentric Earth Equatorial (Mean); GEI,"The origin is the center of the Earth.\n\nThe Z-axis (+90 degrees latitude) is aligned with the Earth’s north pole.\n\nThe X-axis (0 degrees longitude and 0 degrees latitude) is aligned with the mean (not true) vernal equinox."
Geographic,Geographic; GEO,"Astropy's ITRS frame"
GeocentricSolarEcliptic,Geocentric Solar Ecliptic; GSE,"The origin is the center of the Earth.\n\nThe X-axis (0 degrees longitude and 0 degrees latitude) is aligned with the Earth-Sun line.\n\nThe Z-axis (+90 degrees latitude) is aligned with the component perpendicular to the X-axis of the mean ecliptic pole at the observation time."
Geomagnetic,Geomagnetic; MAG,"The origin is the center of the Earth.\n\nThe Z-axis (+90 degrees latitude) is aligned with the Earth’s magnetic north pole.\n\nThe X-axis (0 degrees longitude and 0 degrees latitude) is aligned with the component of the Earth’s geographic north pole that is perpendicular to the Z-axis."
SolarMagnetic,Solar Magnetic; SM,"The origin is the center of the Earth.\n\nThe Z-axis (+90 degrees latitude) is aligned with the Earth’s magnetic north pole.\n\nThe X-axis (0 degrees longitude and 0 degrees latitude) is aligned with the component of the Earth-Sun line that is perpendicular to the Z-axis."
GeocentricSolarMagnetospheric,Geocentric Solar Magnetospheric; GSM,"The origin is the center of the Earth.\n\nThe X-axis (0 degrees longitude and 0 degrees latitude) is aligned with the Earth-Sun line.\n\nThe Z-axis (+90 degrees latitude) is aligned with the component of the Earth’s magnetic north pole that is perpendicular to the X-axis."
