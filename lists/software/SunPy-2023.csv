Heliocentric Aries Ecliptic (Mean J2000.0 or Date),Astropy's HeliocentricMeanEcliptic,"If using an Astropy version before v3.2, use the misleadingly named HeliocentricTrueEcliptic"
Heliocentric Cartesian,Heliocentric,"Z=Sun-observer line, YZ-plane contains solar rotation axis"
Heliocentric Earth Ecliptic,HeliocentricEarthEcliptic,"X=Sun-Earth line, XZ-plane contains the mean ecliptic north pole"
Heliocentric Earth Equatorial,HeliographicStonyhurst,"Specify the coordinate representation using CartesianRepresentation, and retrieve the representation via the attribute .cartesian"
Heliocentric Inertial,HeliocentricInertial,"Z=solar rotational axis, X=solar ascending node on mean ecliptic (J2000.0)"
Heliocentric of Date,none,"Z=solar rotational axis, X=solar ascending node on mean ecliptic of date"
Heliocentric Radial,~Heliocentric,"Use a cylindrical representation, but with a 90-degree offset in psi because Heliocentric in cylindrical measures counter-clockwise from the west limb rather than solar north"
Heliocentric/Heliographic Radial-Tangential-Normal,~Heliocentric,"The axes are permuted, with HCC X, Y, Z equivalent respectively to HGRTN Y, Z, X"
Heliographic Carrington,HeliographicCarrington,
Heliographic Stonyhurst,HeliographicStonyhurst,
Helioprojective Cartesian,Helioprojective,
Helioprojective Radial,none,Is to Heliocentric Radial what HPC is to HCC
Geocentric Earth Equatorial (Mean J2000.0 or Date),GeocentricEarthEquatorial,"Astropy's PrecessedGeocentric is similar, but includes aberration due to Earth motion"
Geocentric Earth Equatorial (True),none,
Geographic,Astropy's ITRS,"Z=true geographic north pole, X=intersection of Greenwich meridian and geographic equator"
Geocentric Solar Ecliptic,GeocentricSolarEcliptic,"X=Earth-Sun line, XZ-plane contains the mean ecliptic north pole"
Geocentric Solar Magnetospheric,none,"Z=projection of northern dipole axis on GSE YZ plane, X=Earthâ€“Sun line"
