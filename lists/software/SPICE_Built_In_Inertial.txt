       1  J2000       Earth mean equator, dynamical equinox of J2000.
                      The root reference frame for SPICE.
 
       2  B1950       Earth mean equator, dynamical equinox of B1950.
                      The B1950 reference frame is obtained by
                      precessing the J2000 frame backwards from
                      Julian year 2000 to Besselian year 1950, using
                      the 1976 IAU precession model.
 
                      The rotation from B1950 to J2000 is
 
                      [ -z ]  [ theta ]  [ -zeta ]
                             3          2          3
                      The values for z, theta, and zeta are computed
                      from the formulas given in table 5 of [5].
 
                      z     =  1153.04066200330"
                      theta =  1002.26108439117"

       3  FK4         Fundamental Catalog (4). The FK4 reference
                      frame is derived from the B1950 frame by
                      applying the equinox offset determined by
                      Fricke.

       4  DE-118      JPL Developmental Ephemeris (118). The DE-118
                      reference frame is nearly identical to the FK4
                      frame. It is also derived from the B1950 frame.
                      Only the offset is different

                      In [2], Standish uses two separate rotations,
 
                      [ 0.00073" ]  P [ 0.5316" ]
                                   3              3
 
                      (where P is the precession matrix used above to
                      define the B1950 frame). The major effect of the
                      second rotation is to correct for truncating the
                      magnitude of the first rotation. At his
                      suggestion, we will use the untruncated value,
                      and stick to a single rotation.
 
 
                      Most of the other DE historical reference frames
                      are defined relative to either the DE-118 or
                      B1950 frame. The values below are taken
                      from [4].

      13  GALACTIC    Galactic System II. The Galactic System II
                      reference frame is defined by the following
                      rotations:
                           o          o            o

                      In the absence of better information, we
                      assume the rotations are relative to the
                      FK4 frame.

      16  MARSIAU     Mars Mean Equator and IAU vector of

                      on the mean equator of Mars where the equator
                      ascends through the earth mean equator.
                      This vector is the cross product of Earth
                      mean north with Mars mean north.

                      The value for the obliquity of the
                      ecliptic at J2000 is taken from page 114
                      of [7] equation 3.222-1. This agrees with the
                      expression given in [5].
