J2000,"Earth mean equator, dynamical equinox of J2000.","The root reference frame for SPICE."
B1950,"Earth mean equator, dynamical equinox of B1950.","The B1950 reference frame is obtained by precessing the J2000 frame backwards from Julian year 2000 to Besselian year 1950, using the 1976 IAU precession model.\n\nThe rotation from B1950 to J2000 is\n\n[ -z ]  [ theta ]  [ -zeta ]\n\n      3          2          3\n\nThe values for z, theta, and zeta are computed from the formulas given in table 5 of [5].\n\n\n\nz     =  1153.04066200330""\n\ntheta =  1002.26108439117""\n\nzeta  =  1152.84248596724""
FK4,Fundamental Catalog (4).,"The FK4 reference frame is derived from the B1950 frame by applying the equinox offset determined by Fricke.\n\n[ 0.525"" ]\n\na      3"
DE-118,"JPL Developmental Ephemeris (118).","The DE-118 reference frame is nearly identical to the FK4 frame. It is also derived from the B1950 frame. Only the offset is different\n\n[ 0.53155" ]\n\n      3\n\nIn [2], Standish uses two separate rotations,\n\n[ 0.00073"" ]  P [ 0.5316"" ]\n\n      3              3\n\n(where P is the precession matrix used above to define the B1950 frame). The major effect of the second rotation is to correct for truncating the magnitude of the first rotation. At his suggestion, we will use the untruncated value, and stick to a single rotation.\n\nMost of the other DE historical reference frames are defined relative to either the DE-118 or B1950 frame. The values below are taken from [4].\n\nDE number  Offset from DE-118  Offset from B1950\n\n---------  ------------------  -----------------\n\n 96            +0.1209"           +0.4107"\n\n102            +0.3956"           +0.1359"\n\n108            +0.0541"           +0.4775"\n\n111            -0.0564"           +0.5880"\n\n114            -0.0213"           +0.5529"\n\n122            +0.0000"           +0.5316"\n\n125            -0.0438"           +0.5754"\n\n130            +0.0069"           +0.5247"
