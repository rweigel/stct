BarycentricMeanEcliptic,Barycentric Mean Ecliptic, "Barycentric mean ecliptic coordinates. These origin of the coordinates are the barycenter of the solar system, with the x axis pointing in the direction of the mean (not true) equinox as at the time specified by the equinox attribute (as seen from Earth), and the xy-plane in the plane of the ecliptic for that date."
BarycentricTrueEcliptic,Barycentric True Ecliptic, Barycentric true ecliptic coordinates. These origin of the coordinates are the barycenter of the solar system, with the x axis pointing in the direction of the true (not mean) equinox as at the time specified by the equinox attribute (as seen from Earth), and the xy-plane in the plane of the ecliptic for that date."
GeocentricMeanEcliptic,Geocentric Mean Ecliptic, "Geocentric mean ecliptic coordinates. These origin of the coordinates are the geocenter (Earth), with the x axis pointing to the mean (not true) equinox at the time specified by the equinox attribute, and the xy-plane in the plane of the ecliptic for that date.\n\nBe aware that the definition of “geocentric” here means that this frame includes light deflection from the sun, aberration, etc when transforming to/from e.g. ICRS."
GeocentricTrueEcliptic,Geocentric True Ecliptic,"Geocentric true ecliptic coordinates. These origin of the coordinates are the geocenter (Earth), with the x axis pointing to the true (not mean) equinox at the time specified by the equinox attribute, and the xy-plane in the plane of the ecliptic for that date.\n\nBe aware that the definition of “geocentric” here means that this frame includes light deflection from the sun, aberration, etc when transforming to/from e.g. ICRS."
HeliocentricEclipticIAU76,Heliocentric Ecliptic IAU76,"Heliocentric mean (IAU 1976) ecliptic coordinates. These origin of the coordinates are the center of the sun, with the x axis pointing in the direction of the mean (not true) equinox of J2000, and the xy-plane in the plane of the ecliptic of J2000 (according to the IAU 1976/1980 obliquity model). It has, therefore, a fixed equinox and an older obliquity value than the rest of the frames."
HeliocentricTrueEcliptic,Heliocentric True Ecliptic,"Heliocentric true ecliptic coordinates. These origin of the coordinates are the center of the sun, with the x axis pointing in the direction of the true (not mean) equinox as at the time specified by the equinox attribute (as seen from Earth), and the xy-plane in the plane of the ecliptic for that date."
CIRS,Celestial Intermediate Reference System,"A coordinate or frame in the Celestial Intermediate Reference System (CIRS)."
FK4,FK4,"Note that this is a barycentric version of FK4 - that is, the origin for this frame is the Solar System Barycenter, not the Earth geocenter."
FK4NoETerms,FK4 No E-Terms,"A coordinate or frame in the FK4 system, but with the E-terms of aberration removed.""
GCRS,Geocentric Celestial Reference System,"A coordinate or frame in the Geocentric Celestial Reference System (GCRS).\n\nGCRS is distinct form ICRS mainly in that it is relative to the Earth’s center-of-mass rather than the solar system Barycenter. That means this frame includes the effects of aberration (unlike ICRS). For more background on the GCRS, see the references provided in the See Also section of the documentation. (Of particular note is Section 1.2 of USNO Circular 179)\n\nThis frame also includes frames that are defined relative to the Earth, but that are offset (in both position and velocity) from the Earth."
HCRS,Heliocentric system, with axes aligned to ICRS,"A coordinate or frame in a Heliocentric system, with axes aligned to ICRS.\n\nThe ICRS has an origin at the Barycenter and axes which are fixed with respect to space.\n\nThis coordinate system is distinct from ICRS mainly in that it is relative to the Sun’s center-of-mass rather than the solar system Barycenter. In principle, therefore, this frame should include the effects of aberration (unlike ICRS), but this is not done, since they are very small, of the order of 8 milli-arcseconds.\n\nFor more background on the ICRS and related coordinate transformations, see the references provided in the See Also section of the documentation."
ICRS,ICRS,"A coordinate or frame in the ICRS system.\n\nIf you’re looking for “J2000” coordinates, and aren’t sure if you want to use this or FK5, you probably want to use ICRS. It’s more well-defined as a catalog coordinate and is an inertial system, and is very close (within tens of milliarcseconds) to J2000 equatorial.\n\nFor more background on the ICRS and related coordinate transformations, see the references provided in the See Also section of the documentation."
LSR,Local Standard of Rest,"A coordinate or frame in the Local Standard of Rest (LSR).\n\nThis coordinate frame is axis-aligned and co-spatial with ICRS, but has a velocity offset relative to the solar system barycenter to remove the peculiar motion of the sun relative to the LSR. Roughly, the LSR is the mean velocity of the stars in the solar neighborhood, but the precise definition of which depends on the study. As defined in Schönrich et al. (2010): “The LSR is the rest frame at the location of the Sun of a star that would be on a circular orbit in the gravitational potential one would obtain by azimuthally averaging away non-axisymmetric features in the actual Galactic potential.” No such orbit truly exists, but it is still a commonly used velocity frame.\n\nWe use default values from Schönrich et al. (2010) for the barycentric velocity relative to the LSR, which is defined in Galactic (right-handed) cartesian velocity components. These values are customizable via the v_bary argument which specifies the velocity of the solar system barycenter with respect to the LSR."
LSRD,Dynamical Local Standard of Rest,"A coordinate or frame in the Dynamical Local Standard of Rest (LSRD).\n\nThis frame is defined as a velocity of U=9 km/s, V=12 km/s, and W=7 km/s in Galactic coordinates or 16.552945 km/s towards l=53.13 b=25.02. This is defined in:\n\nDelhaye 1965, Solar Motion and Velocity Distribution of Common Stars.\n\nThis coordinate frame is axis-aligned and co-spatial with ICRS, but has a velocity offset relative to the solar system barycenter to remove the peculiar motion of the sun relative to the LSRD."
LSRK,Kinematic Local Standard of Rest,"A coordinate or frame in the Kinematic Local Standard of Rest (LSR).\n\nThis frame is defined as having a velocity of 20 km/s towards RA=270 Dec=30 (B1900) relative to the solar system Barycenter. This is defined in:\n\nGordon 1975, Methods of Experimental Physics: Volume 12: Astrophysics, Part C: Radio Observations - Section 6.1.5.\n\nThis coordinate frame is axis-aligned and co-spatial with ICRS, but has a velocity offset relative to the solar system barycenter to remove the peculiar motion of the sun relative to the LSRK."
PrecessedGeocentric,Precessed Geocentric,"A coordinate frame defined in a similar manner as GCRS, but precessed to a requested (mean) equinox. Note that this does not end up the same as regular GCRS even for J2000 equinox, because the GCRS orientation is fixed to that of ICRS, which is not quite the same as the dynamical J2000 orientation."
TETE,Equatorial coordinate or frame using the True Equator and True Equinox,"An equatorial coordinate or frame using the True Equator and True Equinox (TETE).\n\nEquatorial coordinate frames measure RA with respect to the equinox and declination with with respect to the equator. The location of the equinox and equator vary due the gravitational torques on the oblate Earth. This variation is split into precession and nutation, although really they are two aspects of a single phenomena. The smooth, long term variation is known as precession, whilst smaller, periodic components are called nutation.\n\nCalculation of the true equator and equinox involves the application of both precession and nutation, whilst only applying precession gives a mean equator and equinox.\n\nTETE coordinates are often referred to as “apparent” coordinates, or “apparent place”. TETE is the apparent coordinate system used by JPL Horizons and is the correct coordinate system to use when combining the right ascension with local apparent sidereal time to calculate the apparent (TIRS) hour angle.\n\nFor more background on TETE, see the references provided in the See Also section of the documentation. Of particular note are Sections 5 and 6 of USNO Circular 179) and especially the diagram at the top of page 57.\n\nThis frame also includes frames that are defined relative to the center of the Earth, but that are offset (in both position and velocity) from the center of the Earth. You may see such non-geocentric coordinates referred to as “topocentric”."
