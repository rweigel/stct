				Earth Mean Equator and Equinox 
			</fullname>
			<description>
   The Earth Mean Equator and Equinox of Date frame is defined as follows:

      -  +Z axis is aligned with the north-pointing vector normal to the
         mean equatorial plane of the Earth;

      -  +X axis points along the ``mean equinox'', which is defined as the
         intersection of the Earth's mean orbital plane with the Earth's mean
         equatorial plane. It is aligned with the cross product of the
         north-pointing vectors normal to the Earth's mean equator and mean
         orbit plane of date;

      -  +Y axis is the cross product of the Z and X axes and completes the
         right-handed frame;

      -  the origin of this frame is the Earth's center of mass.

   The mathematical model used to obtain the orientation of the Earth's mean
   equator and equinox of date frame is the 1976 IAU precession model, built
   into SPICE.

   The base frame for the 1976 IAU precession model is J2000.

      MAG Frame: from http://rbsp.space.umn.edu/data/rbsp/teams/spice/fk/rbsp_general011.tf
      ---------------------------------------------------------

      Definition :

      Geomagnetic - geocentric. Z axis is parallel to the geomagnetic
      dipole axis, positive north. X is in the plane defined by the Z axis
      and the Earth's rotation axis. If N is a unit vector from the Earth's
      center to the north geographic pole, the signs of the X and Y axes are
      given by Y = N x Z, X = Y x Z.. See Russell, 1971
      

      The implementation of this frame is complicated in that the definition
      of the IGRF dipole is a function of time and the IGRF model cannot be
      directly incorporated into Spice. However, Spice does allow one to define
      time dependent Euler angles. Meaning, you can define an Euler angle
      that rotates GEO to MAG for a given ephemeris time t:

         V           = r(t) * V
          GEI                  MAG
      
      where r(t) is a time dependent Euler angle representation of a
      rotation. Spice allows for the time dependence to be represented by a
      polynomial expansion. This expansion can be fit using the IGRF model,
      thus representing the IGRF dipole axis.

      IGRF-11 (the 11th version) was fit for the period of 1990-2020, which
      should encompass the mission and will also make this kernel useful for
      performing Magnetic dipole frame transformations for the 1990's and
      the 2000's. However, IGRF-11 is not as accurate for this entire time
      interval. The years between 1945-2005 are labeled definitive, although
      only back to 1990 was used in the polynomial fit. 2005-2010 is
      provisional, and may change with IGRF-12. 2010-2015 was only a
      prediction. Beyond 2015, the predict is so far in the future as to not
      be valid. So to make the polynomials behave nicely in this region (in
      case someone does try to use this frame during that time), the
      2015 prediction was extended until 2020. So for low precision, this
      kernel can be used for the years 2015-2020. Any times less than 1990
      and greater than 2020 were not used in the fit, and therefore may be
      vastly incorrect as the polynomials may diverge outside of this region.
      These coefficients will be refit when IGRF-12 is released.
      
      Also, since the rest of the magnetic dipole frames are defined from
      this one, similar time ranges should be used for those frames.

                  Definitive           Provisional   Predict    Not Valid
       |------------------------------|+++++++++++|###########|???????????|
     1990                           2005        2010        2015        2020

      In addition to the error inherit in the model itself, the polynomial
      expansion cannot perfectly be fit the IGRF dipole. The maximum error
      on the fit is .2 milliradians, or .01 degrees. 

      The MAG frame is achieved by first rotating the GEO frame about Z by
      the longitude degrees, and then rotating about the Y axis by the
      amount of latitude. This matches the new frame to Russell's definition.

      X axis is in plane of z axis and Earth-Sun line, positive sunward.
      See Russell, 1971.

      Thus, this is much like GSM, except that now the +Z axis is the
      primary, meaning it is parallel to the dipole vector, and +X is the
      secondary. Since the X-Z plane is the same as GSM's X-Z plane, the Y
      axis is the same as GSM.
