IAU_JUPITER,,This system is analogous to the geographic (longitude and latitude) system used at the Earth and rotates with Jupiter at the official IAU rotation period. This coordinate system should always be used with respect to the official epoch and rotation rate (as defined by the IAU), with X pointing along the Jupiter Prime Meridian as defined by the IAU, Y lying in the rotational equatorial plane of the planet, and Z along the rotation axis.
IAU_SATURN,,This system is analogous to the geographic (longitude and latitude) system used at the Earth and rotates with Saturn at the official IAU rotation period. This coordinate system should always be used with respect to the official epoch and rotation rate (as defined by the IAU), with X pointing along the Saturn Prime Meridian as defined by the IAU, Y lying in the rotational equatorial plane of the planet, and Z along the rotation axis.
IAU_SUN,This system is analogous to the geographic (longitude and latitude) system used at the Earth and rotates with the Sun at the official IAU rotation period. This coordinate system should always be used with respect to the official epoch and rotation rate (as defined by the IAU), with X pointing along the Sun Prime Meridian as defined by the IAU, Y lying in the rotational equatorial plane of the planet and Z along the rotation axis.
KRTP​,Kronocentric body-fixed, J2000 spherical Coordinates - standard right-handed spherical triad (R, Theta, Phi) for a planet-centered system, with R radial (along the line from the center of Saturn to the center of the spacecraft), and positive away from Saturn, Phi, the azimuthal component, parallel to the Kronographic equator (Omega x R) and positive in the direction of corotation, and Theta, the southward component, completing the right-handed set.
SSE​,Spacecraft Solar Ecliptic, A coordinate system used for deep space spacecraft, for example Helios. - X axis from spacecraft to Sun. Z axis normal to ecliptic plane, positive northward. Note: Angle between normals to ecliptic and to Helios orbit plane ~ 0.25 deg. LSE denomination is sometimes used instead of SSE.
MSM,Mercury solar magnetospheric, A coordinate system with its origin at the center of the planetary dipole moment but otherwise equivalent to the MSO coordinate system.
NEC,North East Earth-Centered frame,
SEQ,Solar Equatorial coordinates, A coordinate system centered at Sun and defined such that Z is along the Sun spin axis, positive in the direction of angular momentum, X normal to Z such that the X-Z plane contains the Sun, positive towards the Sun, and Y completing the right-handed set and pointing approximately in the direction of dusk.
SRF,Spacecraft Reference Frame,
SZS,Saturn-2-spin, a Saturn-centered spin-aligned coordinate system with the primary axis, Z,  parallel to the Saturn spin axis, Y defined as the cross product of this vector with the Saturn - Sun vector, and X completing the right - handed system and directed "towards" the Sun.
