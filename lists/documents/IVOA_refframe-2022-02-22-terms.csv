EQUATORIAL;1;Equatorial;"Umbrella term of all equatorial frames.  Only use for old, pre-FK4 equatorial coordinates."
ICRS;2;ICRS;"International Celestial Reference System as defined by 1998AJ....116..516M."
FK4;2;FK4;"Positions based on the 4th Fundamental Katalog. If no equinox is defined with this frame, assume B1950.0."
FK5;2;FK5;"Positions based on the 5th Fundamental Katalog. If no equinox is defined with this frame, assume J2000.0.  Applications not requiring extremely high precision can identify FK5 at J2000 with ICRS."
eq_FK4;2;FK4;"Old VOTable COOSYS term for FK4.";ivoasem:deprecated ivoasem:useInstead(FK4)
eq_FK5;2;FK5;"Old VOTable COOSYS term for FK5.";ivoasem:deprecated ivoasem:useInstead(FK5)
ECLIPTIC;1;Ecliptic;"Ecliptic coordinates; the ecliptic of J2000.0 is assumed."
ecl_FK4;2;Ecliptic (FK4);Old VOTable COOSYS term ecliptic coordinates for the FK4 ecliptic (of B1950.0).
ecl_FK5;2;Ecliptic (FK5);Old VOTable COOSYS term ecliptic coordinates for the FK5 ecliptic (of J2000.0).;ivoasem:deprecated ivoasem:useInstead(ECLIPTIC)
GENERIC_GALACTIC;1;Galactic;"Umbrella term for Galactic coordinates.  If at all possible, use a more specific term, as historically, many different conventions have been in use."
GALACTIC_I;2;Old Galactic;"Old, pre-1958, Galactic coordinates.  See 1960MNRAS.121..123B for details."
GALACTIC;2;Galactic;"Galactic coordinates, modern definition: Pole at precisely FK4 B1950 192.25, 27.4, origin at approximately FK4 B1950 265.55, -28.92.  See 1960MNRAS.121..123B for details."
galactic;2;Galactic;"Old VOTable COOSYS term for GALACTIC.";ivoasem:deprecated ivoasem:useInstead(GALACTIC)
SUPER_GALACTIC;1;Supergalactic;"Supergalactic coordinates (pole at GALACTIC 47.37, +6.32, origin at GALACTIC 137.37, 0."
supergalactic;1;Supergalactic;Old VOTable COOSYS term for SUPER_GALACTIC;ivoasem:deprecated ivoasem:useInstead(SUPER_GALACTIC)
AZ_EL;1;Azimuth/elevation;"Local azimuth and elevation. (Ground-based observations; Azimuth from North through East.)"
BODY;1;Body Coordinates;"Generic bodycentric coordinates. Data annotated in this way cannot be automatically combined with any other data.  Use or create more specific terms if at all possible."
UNKNOWN;1;Unknown reference frame;"Unknown reference frame. Only to be used as a last resort or for simulations. Data annotated in this way cannot be automatically combined with any other data."
xy;1;Unknown reference frame;Old VOTable COOSYS term for UNKNOWN;ivoasem:deprecated ivoasem:useInstead(UNKNOWN)
barycentric;1;ICRS/Bary;Old VOTable COOSYS term indicating ICRS at BARYCENTER reference position.  In the modern VO, refpos and refframe are no longer represented together.  Do not use this any more.;ivoasem:deprecated ivoasem:useInstead(ICRS)
geo_app;1;(Obscure);An old VOTable COOSYS term, the meaning of which has been lost in time.;ivoasem:deprecated
